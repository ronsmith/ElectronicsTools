#LED Test Board

This is a trivial little board with 4 different color LEDs wired up with resistors so I don't have to keep setting this up on a breadboard. I used two pins for each connection so you can daisy-chain them if, for example, you want to us a common ground. I used male connections rather than female to make it easier if you want to put a multimeter probe on a pin.
